# Monkey D. App

`Monkey D. App` is a tool designed to make it easier to deploy decentralized applications by using [Monkeyfile](https://github.com/monkeydapp/hub/blob/master/README.md).

`Monkeyfile` allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as abi bytecode and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one file. By doing so, the developer can rest assured that the application will be deployable on Ethereum, Ganache or sidechain like Matic.
